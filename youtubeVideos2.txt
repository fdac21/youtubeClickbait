In this video I'm covering strength standards on the squat, bench press and deadlift for male and female natural lifters (men and women). I break this up into six categories of training experience: noob, beginner, intermediate, advanced, elite and freak. I have based these strength standards on what I believe are average abilities from my decade plus of coaching experience, data from competitive powerlifting events (including powerlifting records) and existing strength scales from high level strength training coaches.

description: 
CONTENT WARNING: Today's video is discussing mental health crisis, breakdown, therapy, self h*rm, medication, depresslon, anxiety & more. I wanted to just give you that disclaimer because i know this may be difficult to listen to for some of you who may be going through the same thing. I just wanted to open up about where I have been and what I have been going through and share with you all what I have been feeling and experiencing after having my crisis and then getting help with medication, therapy and time away. 

*Lavender supplement ‚ÄúLavela‚Äù: https://amzn.to/3qtHnIG

I know that this is a very sensitive topic and people have a LOT of opinions one way or another, but every person, every experience is 1000000% different and comparing ourselves to other stories is not helpful - I learned this first hand. If you are struggling, there IS HELP for you. First of all if you are having bad thoughts about harming yourself, here is a hotline you can call. 
National Hotline: 1-800-273-8255

My camera didn't film the part where I was talking about how toxic and bad googling was for me, but my whole point that I tried to make was that Google will confirm or deny anything you want it to. You will find ANYTHING you are looking for on google, bad or good. I saw a Tik Tok of a guy who typed in "does coffee make you blind" and he found a top study suggesting that yes, coffee makes you blind. He then typed in "does coffee make eyesight better" and found top studies saying that yes, coffee can improve eyesight. That you can ALWAYS find what you are looking for, positive or negative - This has helped me not want to google my symptoms and just realize that my body is unique and I will not find anything helpful via google. 

Be honest with your doctor. They are there to HELP. You can ALWAYS go into the hospital and tell them how you are feeling and they will admit you and help. Therapy isn't available or accessible to everyone, but if it IS accessible to you I highly recommend it. I had a big stigma about mental health medication and I was... wrong. I let the stigma get to me and I should have gotten help LONG ago. If you are like me and you are feeling apprehensive, I understand. I understand WHOLEHEARTEDLY. Just take it ONE SECOND at a time, one moment at a time and just trust that even though you CANNOT believe it, you will FEEL BETTER soon and it CAN happen. And it WILL happen it is only a matter of time, white knuckling it through and being HONEST with your physician and letting them know how you are feeling so they can find you the right treatment.

And what better way for Boxing fans to prepare, than to look back at one of the most dominant displays of Saul Alvarez‚Äô illustrious career. 
Here we take a look back to a night where two of the sports heaviest hitters met head on.. And a night where Canelo, on the comeback from his only loss, needed a destructive victory more than ever before.

Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Definitive Edition Gameplay Walkthrough 1 - GTA San Andreas Remastered The Definitive Edition PS5 Gameplay
Experience the blockbuster classic, updated for a new generation with across-the-board enhancements including brilliant new lighting and environmental upgrades, with high-resolution textures, increased draw distance, Grand Theft Auto V-style controls and targeting, and much more.

Five years ago, Carl ‚ÄòCJ‚Äô Johnson escaped the haze of Los Santos, San Andreas...a city tearing itself apart with gang trouble, drugs, and corruption. Now, it's the early 90s. CJ‚Äôs got to go home - his mother has been murdered, his family has fallen apart, and his childhood friends are all heading towards disaster. On his return to the neighborhood, a couple of cops frame him for homicide, forcing CJ on a journey that takes him across the entire state of San Andreas, to save his family and to take control of the streets in the next iteration of the series that changed everything.

Well Theorists, it's finally happened. I'm doing a theory on Subnautica.

So, I'm going to RUIN this game for all of you environmental hopefuls out there who have played through and thought you saved the day... because you DIDN'T!

On the LifeSteal SMP, a Minecraft Server where you can steal other players' hearts... After Parrot Made 12000+ Cakes in Survival Minecraft and after ClownPierce Died on the Deadliest Minecraft SMP... I Made an Illegal Minecraft Vault. Here's Why This Minecraft Vault is Illegal...

Like ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.

Watch the No Major Glitches world record speedrun here: https://youtu.be/ZGmYwp0-3yA
Watch the any% world record speedrun here: https://youtu.be/TAQu4wqyK6w

A couple of notes:
First, I was doing the no major glitches category, instead of the any% category. This is because my Twitch stream voted for that one, so here you go. And secondly, this game is really intensive on your computer while streaming so it lagged in a few places, but mostly was fine. Sorry about that though. 

Poppy Playtime description (on Steam):

ABOUT THIS GAME
You must stay alive in this horror/puzzle adventure. Try to survive the vengeful toys waiting for you in the abandoned toy factory. Use your GrabPack to hack electrical circuits or nab anything from afar. Explore the mysterious facility... and don't get caught.

Welcome to Playtime Co.!
Playtime Co. was once the king of the toy manufacturing industry... until everybody inside of the factory one day disappeared into thin air. Now, years later, you must explore the abandoned factory and uncover the truth.

The Toys
The toys of Playtime Co. are a lively bunch! From Bot to Huggy, Catbee to Poppy, Playtime does it all! As long as you're at Playtime Co., why not pay the toys a little visit? You might just make a few friends...

The GrabPack
This amazing GrabPack is a wearable backpack, accompanied by 2 artificial hands attached via steel wire. With this handy, state-of-the-art tool, there's no limit to what Playtime Co. employees can accomplish! The following list of features should help to show you what the GrabPack has to offer.

The hands' powerful grip allows for movement of heavy objects with ease!

A lengthy and flexible wire gives any employee the ability to reach whatever they may need, no matter the distance!

The steel wire makes conducting electricity a breeze!

The only limit is the length of your GrabPack's wire.

Won't you stick around? There's lots of fun in store for you. It's almost Playtime...

My channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!

From Academy Award nominee Taylor Sheridan, co-creator of Yellowstone, 1883 follows the Dutton family as they embark on a journey west through the Great Plains toward the last bastion of untamed America.

There was nothing Jarad ‚ÄúJuice WRLD‚Äù Higgins enjoyed more than delivering new music to his millions of fans around the world. He left behind an astonishingly deep catalog of music that will ensure his fans will have new songs to listen to for years to come. Jarad was always searingly honest about his struggles and through his musical genius he articulated what was on his heart and mind vividly through his art. He never gave up and had many loved ones and friends around him who never gave up on offering their support to him. Today we announce that we will commemorate his upcoming birthday with a new album ‚ÄúFighting Demons‚Äù on Dec 10th.  We encourage all of you who struggle with addiction and mental illness to never give up the fight.  We continue to extend free support to you via the fund created in his honor: LiveFree999.org

Did you know that in PULP FICTION... In the robbery scene, the coffee shop manager says, "I am not a hero, I'm just a coffee shop --" then gets cut off. In the end credits, he's listed as "Coffee Shop."

channelId: UCEjBDKfrqQI4TgzT9YLNT8g
categoryId: 22
channelTitle: Ghost Town Living
description: 
If you own an abandoned silver mine, it only makes sense to learn how to make silver! And in this video, I took ore that I mined myself 450 ft underground and made a ring. Along the way, I had some great help from Jason, Alissa, Jena, and a few TSA agents. It was one of the most rewarding processes that I've gone through. 

As a small 'thank you' for supporting this channel, we are giving away a second ring! This one and the one I wear are the only ones in the world! It's totally free to sign up and the winner will be randomly selected next month. Sign up here: https://kingsumo.com/g/an70ts/win-a-cerro-gordo-silver-ring

If you're interested in the FIRST time I made silver, that video is here: https://youtu.be/zvgyv-EhW6w

FLOODING POPPY PLAYTIME IN WATER!!! (Can Huggy Swim?) | Poppy Playtime Gameplay (Mods)

What‚Äôs up MA DUDES!!!! How is it going today? Today we are going to be playing Poppy Playtime with the WATER FLOOD MOD!!! We are flooding the entire map of Poppy Playtime and Huggy Wuggy is going to have to learn how to swim!!! In this episode we are filling everything up with water and Huggy Wuggy goes crazy! With these mods, we can do anything we want and my buddy Kokosko has made it so that we can use hacks in Poppy Playtime, fly in Poppy Playtime, noclip in Poppy Playtime, and even prepare for Poppy Playtime Chapter 2! In our last mods we made Huggy Wuggy friendly, we made Huggy Wuggy Tiny and now we are making Huggy Wuggy Swim in Water! Let‚Äôs break the game and play it differently as we hack Poppy Playtime and add mods to FLOOD EVERYTHING IN WATER!!! Enjoy

In Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin, we follow Margot as she ventures to her Amish roots in order to find out where she came from and what happened to her mother. The answer will terrify and shock her to the core, especially with all the dang ghosts around spooking everyone. We're breaking down the story, if it connects to the previous entries, what the community is really all about including their demonic overlord, and explaining the ending that shows us the evil is only beginning.

LYRICS
You shoulda known better better to fuck with someone like me 
Forever and ever you‚Äôre going to wish I was your wifey 

Don‚Äôt act so innocent 
This was no accident 
You planned this in the end 
And now it‚Äôs over 

Say what you want to say 
You lied and I got played 
You threw it all away 
And now it‚Äôs over 

Just face it 
We didn‚Äôt make it 
You bit off more than you can chew 
Can you taste it? 

You shoulda known better better to fuck with someone like me 
Forever and ever you‚Äôre going to wish I was your wifey 
Should‚Äôve held on 
Should‚Äôve treated me right 
I gave you one chance 
You don‚Äôt get it twice 

And we‚Äôll be together never 
So baby you can bite me 
Don‚Äôt hold your breath 
Cause you‚Äôre still choking on your words 
Those things you said might be the last ones that I heard 

So come pick up your clothes from the front yard 
Sprinklers on burn the rest in the backyard 
Should‚Äôve had the guts just to say goodbye 
Now you‚Äôre going to have regrets for the rest of your life 

Just face it 
We didn‚Äôt make it 
You bit off more than you can chew 
Can you taste it? 

You shoulda known better better to fuck with someone like me 
Forever and ever you‚Äôre going to wish I was your wifey 

Should‚Äôve held on 
Should‚Äôve treated me right 
I gave you one chance 
You don‚Äôt get it twice 

And we‚Äôll be together never 
So baby you can bite me 

I bet you taste me on the tip of your tongue 
Tip of your tongue 
Tip of your tongue 
I fell fast when I know I shoulda run 
Know I shoulda run 
Know I shoulda run 
I bet you taste me on the tip of your tongue 
Tip of your tongue 
Tip of your tongue 
I fell fast when I know I shoulda run 
Know I shoulda run 
Know I shoulda run 

You shoulda known better better to fuck with someone like me 
Forever and ever you‚Äôre going to wish I was your wifey 
Should‚Äôve held on 
Should‚Äôve treated me right 
I gave you one chance 
You don‚Äôt get it twice 
And we‚Äôll be together never 
So baby you can bite me

Today we beat Minecraft but in a car with Dream and Georgenotfound and Sapnap too, we all had fun just like they have fun in Minecraft manhunt. Dream said that he would drive the car and beat the game in it, Sapnap also said that he would drive the Minecraft car and beat the game in it, Georgenotfound also said that he would drive the car in Minecraft and beat the Minecraft game in the Minecraft car. But you won't guess what, I also said I'd beat the Minecraft game car in a car Minecraft beating the game the car the game Minecraft. This was actually hilarious, as we all know, Minecraft cars make Minecraft funnier.

‚ÄúI was in the egg for three days,‚Äù says Lady Gaga, as she recounts her Life in Looks for British Vogue. She‚Äôs talking, of course, about the unforgettable Hussein Chalayan ‚Äúvessel‚Äù she arrived at the 2011 Grammys in, held aloft on a litter by six Latex-clad male attendants (the fetishistic fabric required to make their outfits was sourced from a bus company at the last minute, she reveals). That‚Äôs just one of many insights contained in the video that accompanies the House of Gucci star‚Äôs December 2021 cover ‚Äì Gaga also explains that the Schiaparelli look she wore to sing at President Joe Biden‚Äôs inauguration was bulletproof. Watch the video in full for more revelations from Lady Gaga‚Äôs unique fashion journey.

Free Guy was a pretty delightful surprise in the hellscape that was 2021. But it still has sins, so we counted 'em. 

Thursday: gambling sins.

Remember, no movie is without sin. Which movie's sins should we count next?

channelTitle: NBC Sports Chicago
description: 
With the Chicago Bears needing a stop against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and Cassius Marsh securing a vital third-down sack, referee Tony Corrente called the Bears for taunting giving the Steelers a first down. And after the "taunting" it appeared Corrente hip checked Marsh as he ran by. The Football Aftershow crew of Olin Kreutz, Lance Briggs, Alex Brown and Dave Wannstedt debates the hip check and what happened on this play.

On the LifeSteal SMP, a Minecraft Server where you can steal other players' hearts... I weaponized tens of thousands of cakes. Here's How I Weaponized 12,240 Minecraft Cakes 

Like ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.

And welcome back to your regularly scheduled "Project 863" video. The red writing on the walls hasn't stopped at Spellbound Inc, if anything it's become a permanent fixture for the team to keep guessing about. However, today may be the day that some answers are found. After investigating some new writing in upstairs Red Base, the team sets off to Subject 4 to see if they have any ideas for what it could mean. And, when the smoke clears, what they find is shocking, while also making them question how much more of this will come up before they're done with once and for all.

The History Of The Sharingan (Naruto)

Check Out My New Vlog:
https://youtu.be/HvQPLYptFdE

The Sharingan is the d≈çjutsu kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan that appears selectively among its members. It is regarded as one of the "Three Great D≈çjutsu", the others being the Byakugan and the Rinnegan. While its powers originated from Kaguya ≈åtsutsuki's Rinne Sharingan, its independent form was first manifested by Indra ≈åtsutsuki Hagoromo ≈åtsutsuki in the anime).

Alright so in this video I designed various lego sets out of youtubers. This is a nice change of pace from when I designed dude perfect's 50 million playbutton and when I redesigned more minecraft bosses a while ago. However, I did not expect it to be so difficult. Truly was insane. These projects are a lot of fun so I hope you enjoyed! This time I designed Jacksepticeye, SCOTT THE WOZ BABEYYYYYY, and Technoblade.

Squid Game is the largest TV show of all time with 140 million viewers and when I heard that MrBeast was going to recreate the Squid Games in real life I knew I had to be a part of it! I have a history of building the biggest projects on YouTube (SpongeBob's House in my Backyard, Real Life Technoblade, and a Cereal Bowl in my Bedroom), but I've never built something like this. This statue is more of a moving art piece than anything else so I had to bring in my friend from Canada to help build it. After multiple weeks of building we finally finished and delivered it across the country to North Carolina to surprise Jimmy. He was AMAZED at how good it turned out and I can't wait to see it in his "Playing Squid Game in Real Life" video! This was a real challenge to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. 

If you‚Äôre reading this you‚Äôre a real one! 

Comment ‚Äò‚ÄôSquid Games statue is creepy!" so I can notice you!

Not Playing SQUID GAME in Real Life, But $100,000, But In The Circle, But Extreme Hide and Seek, But 1,000 times, But Buried Alive, But Last to Leave, But 24 Hours, But 50 Hours, But Squid Game, or any other video like MrBeast, Stokes Twins, Ben Azelart, Lexi Rivera, Brent Rivera, Pierson, Faze Rug, Carter Sharer, Preston, Unspeakable, Brianna, or Ryan Prunty would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem designs, builds, and surprises MrBeast with an epic Squid Games statue for the inaugural MrBeast Squid Games event!

This is a video where Matthew Beem and the Beem Team built the world's first real life Squid Game statue and surprised @MrBeast  (aka Jimmy Donaldson) with it!

description: 
You all have been sending me some WILD Tiktoks promoting some flat out dangerous and incorrect medical advice, so I put them all together for another TikTok React. Today we look at buttergirl eating butter dipped in ragu, how to stop your period in its tracks, synthol guy building muscles with oil injections, sunscreen contouring, only jayus body hacks, extreme stretching, sparkling water vs. tap water, colonic cleanses, russian chiropractor treatments, cigars vs. cigarettes, tobacco use, garlic in your nose to clean congestion, the acidity of gatorade, clearing your baby's sinuses, keloid scars, microneedling, ear candling, earwax removal, and as always CHEST COMPRESSIONS!

I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there‚Äôs a subject you want me to discuss or something you‚Äôd like for me to react to, leave a comment down below. Many of my videos have been born out of suggestions directly from you, so don‚Äôt hold back!

The U.S. Congress has passed a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and sent it to President Biden's desk. Today's show tells you some of the initiatives in it and explains why it took several months to pass. We're also discussing jobs and the state of the American economy, and we're exploring why the U.S. "falls back" to standard time.

Canelo √Ålvarez vs. Caleb Plant, billed as Road to Undisputed, was a super middleweight unification professional boxing match contested between WBA, WBC, WBO and The Ring champion Canelo √Ålvarez and IBF champion Caleb Plant to determine the first undisputed super middleweight champion in boxing history.
Canelo Alvarez (57-1-2, 39 KOs) scored a pair of knockdowns in Round 11 to stop Caleb Plant (21-1, 12 KOs) via TKO and make history inside the MGM Grand Garden Arena. The 31-year-old superstar became the first boxer to unify all four recognized titles at 168 pounds and the first Mexican fighter to become an undisputed champion.

About Jurassic World: 
From Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment, Jurassic World immerses audiences of all ages in a new era of wonder and thrills where dinosaurs and humankind must learn to coexist. Jurassic World is set against a global backdrop of diverse locations, with a sprawling story grounded in believable science and populated by distinctive dinosaurs, heroic humans, and cunning villains at both ends of the evolutionary spectrum.

Cinema's only dinosaur-driven live action franchise, Jurassic World has earned three Academy Awards¬Æ and over $3.6 billion worldwide across four films. Its cross- generational appeal can be attributed to audiences' enduring fascination with dinosaurs and boundless imagination, both nurtured by each new installment. Jurassic World is more than a film franchise. It is a larger-than-life destination for exploration, discovery, and epic adventure. Dinosaurs live again, and they live in Jurassic World.

Lyrics:
If you would just make one mistake
What a relief that would be
But I think for as long as we‚Äôre together
I‚Äôll be the only heartbreaker

I‚Äôll be the only heartbreaker

So I‚Äôll be the loser in this game
I‚Äôll be the bad guy in the play
I‚Äôll be the water main that‚Äôs burst and flooding
You‚Äôll be by the window, only watching

I‚Äôll be the only heartbreaker

I apologize 
You forgive me
I apologize
You forgive me

And make me the only heartbreaker
So I‚Äôll be the only heartbreaker

The record-breaking 15th season of It‚Äôs Always Sunny in Philadelphia is its most ambitious yet. In the seismic wake of Covid-19 and all things 2020, The Gang stands at a crossroads in this strange new world. The rules are changing quicker than anyone can keep up with, despite herculean efforts from Mac (Rob McElhenney), Charlie (Charlie Day), Dennis (Glenn Howerton), Dee (Kaitlin Olson) and Frank (Danny DeVito) to continue business as usual. Now, they must face the music and decide who they‚Äôll become in the cultural upheaval that is 2021. Across the span of eight episodes ‚Äî and the Atlantic Ocean ‚Äî we find them answer in a way only they could think to.

Recipe

2 cups flour 
1.5 teaspoons sea salt (you can use other salt) 
1 teaspoon instant yeast 
1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
¬æ cup warm water
2-3 teaspoons olive oil 

Shredded cheese, sauce, toppings, underlings 

Sift the dry stuff in a bowl and then add the wet stuff 
Hangjangle it until you have some nice baking cement 
If you can't form the dough into a floppy clump you might want to add more flour

On a floured surface, place the dough and kneed it for ten minutes 
Add flour to the surface and your hands and the dough as you go so it gets just 
unsticky enough to handle but don't overdo it

Grease up another bowl with olive oil then throw your bag of goo in there, wrap it tightly with surround wrap, and wait 2 to 3 hours. You can also cover with a damp cloth, you're just keeping it from drying out. You can also just hot box a small room with a humidifier for all I care. 

Cut your dough in half  unless you want to make a thick crusted pizza in a 12 inch pan or a bigger one on a cookie sheet 
Grease up your pan and spread out the dough with your fingers. Spread further than you want to compensate for contractions. If the contractions get too intense immediately give your dough a pregnancy test 

Put your pan on medium low and when the dough starts to bubble a bit add the sauce, cheese, and toppings. Congratulations, you're at the point of no return. 

Undoh's on 425 (fourtwentyfundoh). Throw the pizza in for 10-14 minutes. Don't literally throw it as that will create a mess. Keep an eye on it. After you take it out you can cook the bottom more if you don't think it's done enough. 

After you've taken it out REMIND YOURSELF NOT TO GRAB THE HANDLE OF YOUR PAN. It seems obvious but it's so easy to forget. Either turn the handle toward the back of your stovetop or put your glove on it as a reminder. Burnt hands do not feel good. 

AND NOW WAIT!! Here's the thing. When you order pizza delivery it's been cooling down in the box for a while. The pizza coming out of the onion is super fucking hot. Don't eat it right away. Practice some restraint for once in your life. Leave it for a good ten minutes to avoid burning the roof of your mouth. Clean the kitchen or something. Just don't eat that pizza or you will be in a world of pain. I know from experience because I'm a dumbass.

description: 
Earlier in 2021, YouTube experimented with making the public dislike count private to see if it would help reduce dislike attacks across the platform. And after analysis conducted in July of this year, we did see a reduction. Now, the YouTube public dislike count will be made private (but the dislike button is staying). Viewers can still dislike videos, and that action will be used to tune their personal recommendations. But, viewers won‚Äôt be able to see the dislike count -- only creators can see it in YouTube Studio.

Lyrics
Wait a minute this love started out so tender, so sweet
But now she got me 
Smokin out the window

Must have spent 35, $45,000 up in Tiffany‚Äôs (oh no)
Got her bad ass kids runnin round my whole crib like it‚Äôs Chuck E Cheese (whoa, whoa)
Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC
Can‚Äôt believe it (can‚Äôt believe it)
I‚Äôm in disbelief
This bitch got me payin her rent, payin for trips, diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists
And here I am all alone (all alone)
I‚Äôm so cold, I‚Äôm so cold, you got me out here

Smokin out the window (smoking out the window)
Singing how could she do this to me (how could she do this to me)
Oh I thought that girl belonged to only me
But I was wrong
Cuz she belong to everybody, everybody

Just the other night she was grippin on me tight
Screamin Hercules (Hercules, Hercules)
Got me in the club looking for a new love someone help me please (help me please, help me please)
Baby why you doin this, why you doin this to me, girl
Not to be dramatic but I wanna die
This bitch got me paying her rent, paying for trips, diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists
And here I am all alone. (All alone)
I‚Äôm so cold, I‚Äôm so cold.
You got me out here

Smokin out the window
(Smokin out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo)
Singin how could she do this to me (how could she do this)
Oh I thought that girl belonged to only me
(one things fo sho, one things for sho)
But I was wrong (I was wrong)
Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody, that girl yes she belong to everybody)

Oh no
Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need
But I also hope that your trifling ass is walking round barefoot in these streets, lookout

Girl it breaks my heart that you ain‚Äôt right here with me
Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) to the city
Oh, you got me

Smokin out the window
Singing how could she do this to me (How could she do this baby?)
Oh I thought that girl belonged to only me
But I was wrong (I was wrong)
Cause she belong to everybody (she belong to everybody)
She belong to everybody

LYRICS:
I WOULDN‚ÄôT MIND BEING ALONE
I WOULDN‚ÄôT KEEP CHECKING MY PHONE
WOULDN‚ÄôT TAKE THE LONG WAY HOME
JUST TO DRIVE MYSELF CRAZY
I WOULDN‚ÄôT BE LOSING SLEEP
REMEMBERING EVERYTHING
EVERYTHING YOU SAID TO ME
LIKE I‚ÄôM DOING LATELY

YOU, YOU WOULDN‚ÄôT BE ALL
ALL THAT I WANT
BABY I COULD LET GO

IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU I‚ÄôD BE GOOD BY NOW
I‚ÄôD BE BETTER THAN BARELY GETTING BY SOMEHOW
YEAH IT WOULD BE EASY NOT MISS YOU
WONDER ABOUT WHO‚ÄôS WITH YOU
TURN THE WANT YOU OFF
WHENEVER I WANT TOO
IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU
IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU

I WOULDN‚ÄôT STILL CRY SOMETIMES
WOULDN‚ÄôT HAVE TO FAKE A SMILE
PLAY IT OFF AND TELL A LIE
WHEN SOMEBODY ASKED HOW I‚ÄôVE BEEN
I‚ÄôD TRY TO FIND SOMEONE NEW
IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING I CAN DO
BABY IF IT WEREN‚ÄôT FOR YOU
I WOULDN‚ÄôT BE IN THE STATE THAT I‚ÄôM IN

YEAH YOU
YOU WOULDN‚ÄôT BE ALL
ALL THAT I WANT
BABY I COULD LET GO

IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU I‚ÄôD BE GOOD BY NOW
I‚ÄôD BE BETTER THAN BARELY GETTING BY SOMEHOW
YEAH IT WOULD BE EASY NOT MISS YOU
WONDER ABOUT WHO‚ÄôS WITH YOU
TURN THE WANT YOU OFF
WHENEVER I WANT TOO
IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU
IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU
IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU 

IT WOULDN‚ÄôT BE SO HARD TO SEE YOU
KNOW HOW MUCH I NEED YOU
WOULDN‚ÄôT HATE THAT I STILL FEEL LIKE I DO
IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU

IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU
IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU

IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU I‚ÄôD BE GOOD BY NOW
I‚ÄôD BE BETTER THAN BARELY GETTING BY SOMEHOW

YEAH IT WOULD BE EASY NOT MISS YOU
WONDER ABOUT WHO‚ÄôS WITH YOU
TURN THE WANT YOU OFF
WHENEVER I WANT TOO
IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU
IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU
IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU

IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU 
IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU 
IF I DIDN‚ÄôT LOVE YOU

Lyrics
Usually never cry at all 
I would say I‚Äôm pretty tough 
But it‚Äôs been a couple weeks now and I still feel stuck in my lungs
And usually I go out on nights 
And not think of u once 
But if they start playing that song 
I can‚Äôt help but to think about us 

Really thought I‚Äôd be done with the hardest part 
When I pulled myself out of my arms 
Wish I knew that was only the start 
and now I‚Äôm falling apart 
cause 

Last night for the very first time 
You didn‚Äôt even try to call 
oh I 
won‚Äôt lie 
I thought I might die 
I couldn‚Äôt even sleep at all 
And maybe I‚Äôll get used to it 
But right now I just feel like shit 

So I kissed somebody else 
Just to see how it felt 
But all that was going through my brain 
Was your hands around my waist 
You know how to do it so well 

Really thought I‚Äôd be done with the hardest part 
When I pulled myself out of my arms 
Wish I knew that was only the start 
and now I‚Äôm falling apart 
cause 

Last night for the very first time 
You didn‚Äôt even try to call 
oh I 
won‚Äôt lie 
I thought I might die 
I couldn‚Äôt even sleep at all 
And maybe I‚Äôll get used to it 
But right now I just feel like shit 

And if I get a little too drunk 
I start thinking 
What if you were the one? 
But I know that the damage is done 
And I still have the shirt that you wore 
When we first met 
It‚Äôs there on the floor 
I might kick it under the bed 
Hoping that I could forget 
That 

Last night for the very first time 
You didn‚Äôt even try to call 
oh I 
won‚Äôt lie 
I thought I might die 
I couldn‚Äôt even sleep at all 
And maybe I‚Äôll get used to it 
But right now I just feel like shit ¬†
